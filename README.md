This documentation describes the process to apply and validate an IoT Device as FIWARE Ready .

To join FIWARE-ready IoT Devices Program, you need to follow a series of steps, including an simple validation of your
product (implementation), where you will connect it to a FIWARE public instance and you will perform a series of tests:

-   IoT services creation (optional)
-   Device registration
-   Obtain the list of devices (optional)
-   Send measurements
-   Read measurements (optional)

Second step of the validation process requires you to fill in a template to describe how your hardware device
communicates with FIWARE.

This validation process is an auto evaluation process but it is assisted by FIWARE-ready IoT Devices Program reviewers
(IoTReady@lists.fiware.org) who will review your tests logs and evaluate whether your device is connecting with the
public instance correctly.

Once you have successfully completed the FIWARE-ready IoT Devices Program, your device will be published on
[FIWARE Marketplace](http://marketplace.fiware.org​).

## Background

Over 120 cities in Europe and Latin America belong to the Open & Agile Smart Cities (OASC) Alliance Initiative. They
have agreed to operate, share and publish their smart city data using the FIWARE interoperability model.

The FIWARE ecosystem means a straightforward business opportunity for IoT products: It is simple, the FIWARE IoT stack
handles well-known IoT protocol standards and provides an enhanced OpenStack-based cloud environment plus a powerful set
of standard REST APIs to ease the development of smart applications.

Thousands of companies, including large corporations, startups, SMEs and individual developers worldwide are willing to
provide their Internet of Things (IoT) solutions to these cities, basing their solutions on FIWARE open source platform
components.

So far, developers needed to search for **compatible** IoT products and find out how to make them work. The FIWARE-ready
IoT Devices Program provides the answer as it is designed to demonstrate the ability of the IoT solutions to
interoperate seamlessly with FIWARE platforms. The database of products and developers that have successfully
accomplished the FIWARE-ready IoT Devices Program is the catalogue of the ecosystem of IoT hardware producers and
technology providers that can be selected by the OASC Alliance cities to build their smart city solutions.
