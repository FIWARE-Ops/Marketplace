This documentation describes the process to apply and validate an IoT Device as FIWARE Ready.

To be featured as a FIWARE-ready IoT Device, you need to follow some steps, including a simple validation of your
product (implementation), where you will connect it to one of the FIWARE public instances available and you will have to
perform the following tests:

-   IoT services creation (optional)
-   Device registration
-   Obtain the list of devices (optional)
-   Send measurements
-   Read measurements (optional)

This validation process is an auto-evaluation process but it is assisted by FIWARE-ready IoT Device reviewers
[mailto:IoTReady@lists.fiware.org](IoTReady@lists.fiware.org), who will review your tests logs and evaluate whether your
device is connecting with the public instance correctly. Once you have successfully completed the FIWARE-ready IoT
Devices Program, your device will be published on `http://marketplace.fiware.org`.

## Background

The FIWARE ecosystem means a straightforward business opportunity for IoT products: It is simple, the **FIWARE IoT
stack** handles well-known IoT protocol standards and provides an enhanced OpenStack-based cloud environment plus a
powerful set of standard REST APIs to ease the development of smart applications.

A growing number of companies, including large corporations, startups, SMEs and individual developers worldwide are
willing to provide their solutions based on FIWARE open-source [components](https://github.com/fiware/catalogue).

So far, developers needed to search compatible IoT products and find out how to make them work. The certification of
FIWARE-ready IoT Devices provides the answer as it is designed to demonstrate the ability of the IoT solutions to
seamless interoperate with FIWARE platforms. The database of products and developers that have successfully been
featured and certified as FIWARE-ready IoT Devices will be part of the FIWARE Marketplace, a global one-stop shop that
gives visibility to a wide range of Powered by FIWARE solutions/platforms, FIWARE-ready technologies as well as FIWARE
related training/coaching or consultancy, integration and support services. The FIWARE Marketplace serves the purpose of
globally disseminating existing commercial offerings around FIWARE.
