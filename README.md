This documentation describes the process to apply and validate an IoT Device as FIWARE Ready.

To be featured as a _"FIWARE-Ready"_ IoT device, you need to follow some steps, including a simple validation of your
product (implementation), where you will connect it to one of the FIWARE public instances available and you will have to
perform the following tests:

-   IoT services creation (optional)
-   Device registration
-   Obtain the list of devices (optional)
-   Send measurements
-   Read measurements (optional)

This validation process is an auto-evaluation process but it is assisted by _"FIWARE-Ready"_ IoT Device reviewers
[mailto:IoTReady@lists.fiware.org](IoTReady@lists.fiware.org), who will review your tests logs and evaluate whether your
device is connecting with the public instance correctly. Once you have successfully completed the _"FIWARE-Ready"_ IoT
device program, your device will be published on the _"FIWARE-Ready"_ IoT devices section of the
[FIWARE Marketplace](https://marketplace.fiware.org/pages/devices).

## Background

FIWARE **NGSI** is a universal standard for context data management used to facilitate the development of Smart
Solutions. The FIWARE ecosystem means a straight-forward business opportunity for IoT products - It is simple, any
device which is capable of directly or indirectly communicating using the NSGI protocol can be plugged into literally
any FIWARE-based smart solution. This eliminates vendor lock-in and allows new entrants to the IoT device market to
ensure their compatibility with existing solutions apriori.

Smart solutions _"powered by FIWARE"_ can easily integrate new IoT devices, and can leverage the existing FIWARE
open-source [components](https://github.com/fiware/catalogue) to communicate with those devices via existing well-known
IoT protocols.

So far, developers have needed to search compatible IoT products and find out how to make them work. The certification
of _"FIWARE-Ready"_ IoT devices provides the answer, as it is designed to demonstrate the ability of the IoT solutions
to seamless interoperate with FIWARE platforms.

The database of products and developers that have successfully been featured and certified as _"FIWARE-Ready"_ IoT
devices will be part of the [FIWARE Marketplace](https://marketplace.fiware.org/pages/devices), a global one-stop shop
that gives visibility to a wide range of _"Powered by FIWARE"_ solutions and platforms, _"FIWARE-Ready"_ technologies as
well as FIWARE related training/coaching or consultancy, integration and support services. The **FIWARE Marketplace**
serves the purpose of globally disseminating existing commercial offerings across the FIWARE ecosystem.
