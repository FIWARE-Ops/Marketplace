# How to apply

FIWARE-ready technologies are technologies that can easily be integrated with FIWARE in a plug&play manner in order to
bring extended platform capabilities for developers. FIWARE-ready software enablers are platform components, easily
integrable with FIWARE, which extend the basic FIWARE capabilities with advanced added-value features (e.g., location
within buildings, representation of context information in maps, biometrics for access control…). Their combination with
FIWARE allows to build more sophisticated applications.

1.  First of all you need to do a self assessment in order to determine whether your product is really “FIWARE-Ready” or
    not. Please bear in mind that for gaining the “FIWARE-Ready” label you would need to provide software connectors
    between your component and one or more FIWARE enablers. For instance, if you are providing advanced visualization
    capabilities for context information, then you would need to offer an off-the-shelf connector between your platform
    and FIWARE NGSI.

2.  Go to `http://marketplace.fiware.org/apply`. Register. Then choose “FIWARE-ready - Software enabler” under
    “category” and one or more proper domains for your product or system.

3.  Fill up the rest of fields with as many information as possible so that evaluators can grant your application
    smoothly. An important and mandatory part will be one or more manuals that will describe how to connect your
    technology and one or more FIWARE enablers.

4.  You might be asked to provide extra information or to have an interview with FIWARE Experts who might require extra
    information about your solution, so that they can make an informed decision.

5.  In the event that your application is correct and satisfies all the requirements, congratulations you are now part
    of the FIWARE marketplace!.
