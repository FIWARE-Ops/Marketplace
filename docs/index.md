# About the program

The FIWARE ecosystem means a straightforward business opportunity for IoT products: It is simple, the **FIWARE IoT
stack** handles well-known IoT protocol standards and provides an enhanced OpenStack-based cloud environment plus a
powerful set of standard REST APIs to ease the development of smart applications.

A growing number of companies, including large corporations, startups, SMEs and individual developers worldwide are
willing to provide their solutions based on FIWARE open-source [components](https://github.com/fiware/catalogue).

So far, developers needed to search compatible IoT products and find out how to make them work. The certification of
**FIWARE-ready** IoT Devices provides the answer as it is designed to demonstrate the ability of the IoT solutions to
seamless interoperate with FIWARE platforms. The database of products and developers that have successfully been
featured and certified as **FIWARE-ready** IoT Devices will be part of the FIWARE Marketplace, a global one-stop shop
that gives visibility to a wide range of Powered by FIWARE solutions/platforms, **FIWARE-ready** technologies as well as
FIWARE related training/coaching or consultancy, integration and support services. The FIWARE Marketplace serves the
purpose of globally disseminating existing commercial offerings around FIWARE.
