# About the program

FIWARE **NGSI** is a universal standard for context data management used to facilitate the development of Smart
Solutions. The FIWARE ecosystem means a straight-forward business opportunity for IoT products - It is simple, any
device which is capable of directly or indirectly communicating using the NSGI protocol can be plugged into literally
any FIWARE-based smart solution. This eliminates vendor lock-in and allows new entrants to the IoT device market to
ensure their compatibility with existing solutions apriori.

#### Powered by FIWARE

To be a _"Powered by FIWARE"_ solution, a solution must be based on context data and integrated around a context broker.
Smart solutions _"powered by FIWARE"_ can easily integrate new IoT devices, and can leverage the existing FIWARE
open-source [components](https://github.com/fiware/catalogue) to communicate with those devices via existing well-known
IoT protocols.

#### FIWARE Ready

So far, developers needed to search compatible IoT products and find out how to make them work. The certification of
_"FIWARE-Ready"_ IoT devices provides the answer, as it is designed to demonstrate the ability of the IoT solutions to
seamlessly interoperate with FIWARE platforms. To be _"FIWARE-Ready"_, a device must be able to retrieve and respond to
messages in the NSGI format.

The ability for an IoT device to be _"FIWARE-Ready"_ can be supplied either **directly** - with software on the device
or **indirectly** - via the use of intermediate services such as an IoT Agent which can be used to translate proprietary
message formats and transport protocols to NGSI.

## FIWARE Marketplace

The database of products and developers that have successfully been featured and certified as _"FIWARE-Ready"_ IoT
devices will be part of the [FIWARE Marketplace](https://marketplace.fiware.org/pages/devices), a global one-stop shop
that gives visibility to a wide range of _"Powered by FIWARE"_ solutions and platforms, _"FIWARE-Ready"_ technologies as
well as FIWARE related training/coaching or consultancy, integration and support services. The **FIWARE Marketplace**
serves the purpose of globally disseminating existing commercial offerings across the FIWARE ecosystem.

#### How to apply

Currently activities within the marketplace are filtered into six separate categories. The criteria to be registered
under each section varies accordingly - check the details in the subsections below.

-   [_"Powered by FIWARE"_ Solution](solution/apply.md) - a full end-to-end solution based on context data and
    integrated around a context broker.
-   [_"Powered by FIWARE"_ Platform](platform/apply.md) - a cloud-based environment for hosting and automatic deployment
    of _"Powered by FIWARE"_ Solutions.
-   [_"FIWARE-Ready"_ IoT Device](device/apply.md) - a class of IoT devices which are able to send and respond to
    messages in the NSGI format, either directly or indirectly via the use of an IoT Agent which can translate
    proprietary message formats and transport protocols.
-   [_"FIWARE-Ready"_ Software Enablers](enabler/apply.md) - software supporting the NGSI interfaces which is able to
    interact with the context broker
-   [FIWARE Consulting, Integration and Technical Support Services](consulting/apply.md) - technical support services
    for deploying and maintaining FIWARE solutions in the field.
-   [FIWARE Training and Coaching Service](training/apply.md) - training and coaching on how to use FIWARE.

This document includes advice for applicants as well as procedures to be used by validators. A full understanding of how
the validation process works can help smooth the process to get your FIWARE solution or device to be accredited
correctly.
